# Operating-systems-Project
This is my operating systems project in the 7th semester of the university.

this project is about concurrency and process synchronization, and its about solving the doctors and patients problem using semaphore.
this problem is solved in 2 cases:
    1) 1 doctor and inf number of patients
    2) inf doctor and inf number of patients
   
I used java threads to solve this problem.
